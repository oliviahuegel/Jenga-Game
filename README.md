# Jenga-Game
Python program that allows the user to play against the computer in a game of Jenga

This program will generate a random integer to indicate the player’s or comuter’s risk associated with their removal of a Jenga block; high risk moves are more likely to make the tower fall:
• L, Low risk: 0 to 3
• M, Medium risk: 4 to 7
• H, High risk: 8 to 10

If the user does not provide L, M, or H, choose a random integer between 0 and 10 as the risk factor.
Always select a random integer between 0 and 10 for the computer.
